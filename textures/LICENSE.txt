This is licensing info for the textures/ folder.

- Smooth.tga

Like 200 different addons distribute this. I have no idea where it came from and what its licensing is. Ask someone else!

- black255_32px.tga
- gray125_32px.tga
- thickborder.tga

I (Morsker) made these in GIMP, and there are .xcf source files for them available in the repository. I grant anyone the right to use this work for any purpose, without any conditions, unless such conditions are required by law.
